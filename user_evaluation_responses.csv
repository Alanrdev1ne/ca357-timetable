How would you do other courses?
Try to fully utilise the width of the screen so that modules with long names look less cramped",8,"It is very easy to read and understand
The colour scheme is good too

On mobile, make the days of the week more spaced out (i.e. give the word ""Monday"" more space)
Put lines between the different lectures/labs on mobile
How would you do more than one course?
It is awkward to scroll all the way down to Thursday and Friday",,"Modules with long names are difficult to read
Thursday and Friday are quite far down the page","I would make full use of the screen width, when the website is being looked at through a computer/laptop",9
